## Rules the structure holds

- PR-1: at most one active registration per member and
  event (partial unique index on event_id and member_id
  where status is active).
- PR-1, PR-2: a registration refers to a real event and
  a real member (foreign keys).
- PR-2: a cancelled registration keeps its row, with
  its status and cancelled_at; it is never deleted.
- PR-4: at most one current assignment per member and
  event (partial unique index where revoked_at is empty).
- Capacity is more than 0; an event ends after it
  starts; each status comes from its fixed list
  (CHECK constraints).
- Intent: deleting an event or member that has
  registrations is refused, so history survives.

## Rules that need more than structure

- PR-2, cancelled_at filled exactly when status is
  cancelled: a CHECK constraint, Chapter 21.
- PR-3, never more active places than capacity:
  transactions, Chapter 33.
- PR-4, own registrations and assigned events only:
  Chapters 27 and 30.
- PR-5, valid details before publication; drafts hidden:
  Chapters 21, 25, and 26.
- PR-6, access administration: Chapters 23 and 30.

## Open questions

- Which contact details, beyond an email address?
- Are addresses that differ only in letter case one
  member? Decided in Chapter 21, before sign-up.
- Who appoints organizers, and must an event have one?
- When registration opens and closes (Chapter 2 policy).
- What happens to active registrations when an event
  is cancelled?

## Out of scope for this release

- Category and tag: not first-release requirements.
- Venue: the location is an attribute of the event;
  an online event records Virtual as its location.
- Attendance, check-in, and waitlists: Chapter 46.
- Communities and tenancy: Chapters 67 and 68.
- Audit records: Chapter 65.
